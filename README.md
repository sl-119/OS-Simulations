# OS-Simulations
Implementation of OS concepts

This repository contains my lab assignments and implementations for the **Operating Systems** course.  
The experiments cover core OS concepts such as process scheduling, deadlock handling, IPC, thread management, and memory management.

## ðŸ“Œ List of Experiments

| S.No | Experiment | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Unix Command Programs** | Implemented C programs for basic Unix commands like `ls`, `rm`, `cat`, `ps`, `kill`, `wc`. |
| 2 | **Command Interpreter (Shell)** | Developed a minimal shell with support for I/O redirection. |
| 3 | **Classical IPC Problems** | Implemented solutions for classical IPC synchronization problems using `pthread` library and System V IPC:<br> - Producer-Consumer <br> - Dining Philosophers <br> - Readers-Writers <br> - Sleeping Barber <br> - Chain Smoker |
| 4 | **Custom Thread Library** | Created a simplified thread library using **UContext system calls**, with functionality for thread creation, termination, and scheduling (Round Robin). |
| 5 | **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** | Implemented CPU scheduling algorithms (using custom thread library): <br> - FCFS <br> - SJF <br> - Priority Scheduling <br> - Round Robin |
| 6 | **Deadlock Handling** | Implemented **Bankerâ€™s Algorithm** for deadlock avoidance and detection using System V IPC. |
| 7 | **Page Replacement Algorithms** | Implemented memory page replacement policies: <br> - FIFO <br> - LRU <br> - Optimal |
